                        3.I am pretty bad at front end stuff but i have tried to give best and
                        there is some bad cases in backend like multiple allow , permamnent allow,
                        Weth(makes no cost for requesting) and block dependency..
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        4.I shall remove these things in future because backend code has already
                        crossed over 250+ lines..
                    </p>
